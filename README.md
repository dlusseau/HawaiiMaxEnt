This repository contains the data published in Self et al. 2021 Ecological Solutions and Evidence. If you use this data, you need to cite this source as well as acknowledge the Pacific Whale Foundation.

the data is the observations used to fit the SDM including explanatory variables. the variables are:
Trip.ID: unique ID of the WW trip
Sighting.ID: unique ID of the dolphin sighting
Latitude: fraction of degrees
Longitude: fraction of degress
Species: species name
calf: calf presence (YES/NO)
tides: tidal height (in ft) during the observation
SST: sea surface temperature (Celsius)
zone.velocity: zonal currents velocity (m/sec) at a spatial resolution of 0.33 degrees (Latitude) x 0.33 degrees (Longitude) at a 5-day temporal resolution
zone.max.mask: zonal maximum mask (m/sec) at a spatial resolution of 0.33 degrees (Latitude) x 0.33 degrees (Longitude) at a 5-day temporal resolution
med.velocity: meridional current velocity (m/sec) at a spatial resolution of 0.33 degrees (Latitude) x 0.33 degrees (Longitude) at a 5-day temporal resolution
med.max.mask:meridional current maximum mask (m/sec) at a spatial resolution of 0.33 degrees (Latitude) x 0.33 degrees (Longitude) at a 5-day temporal resolution
reef: reef presence at the location of the observation (YES/NO)
month
season (cool/warm)
